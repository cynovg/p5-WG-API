=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module implements the possibility of authorization, prolongate and logout from the center of development.

    use WG::API::Auth;

    my $response = WG::API::Auth->new({ application_id => 'demo' })->login({ nofollow => '1', redirect_uri => 'yoursite.com/response' } );
    
    my $redirect_uri = $response->{ 'location' };
    ...

=head1 METHODS

=head2 AUTH

=head3 login

Method authenticates user based on Wargaming.net ID (OpenID) which is used in World of Tanks, World of Tanks Blitz, World of Warplanes, and WarGag.ru. To log in, player must enter email and password used for creating account, or use a social network profile. Authentication is not available for iOS Game Center users in the following cases: the account is not linked to a social network account, or email and password are not specified in the profile.

Information on authorization status is sent to URL specified in redirect_uri parameter.

=cut

sub login { 
    $_[0]->_request( 'post', 'auth/login', ['expires_at', 'redirect_uri', 'display', 'nofollow'], undef, $_[1] );

    return $_[0]->status eq 'ok' ? $_[0]->response : undef;
}  

=head3 prolongate

Method generates new access_token based on the current token.

This method is used when the player is still using the application but the current access_token is about to expire.

=cut

sub prolongate { $_[0]->_request( 'post', 'auth/prolongate', ['access_token', 'expires_at'], ['access_token'], $_[1] ) }

=head3 logout

Method deletes user's access_token.

After this method is called, access_token becomes invalid.

=cut

sub logout { $_[0]->_request( 'post', 'auth/logout', ['access_token'], ['access_token'], $_[1] ) }

sub _init {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->{ 'api_uri' } = 'api.worldoftanks.ru/wot';
    $self->SUPER::_init();

    return $self;
}
